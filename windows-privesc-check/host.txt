Title: Windows Service Registry Values Can be Changed By Untrusted Users

[ description ]

Configuration information for Windows Service is stored in the registry. Some of the keys were found to have the KEY_SET_VALUE permission granted for non-administrative users. It would be possible for these users to maliciously modify the registry to change the executable run to a malicious one, or to make the service run with higher privileges. It could lead to a low-privileged user escalating privilges to local administrator.

The registry keys below had KEY_SET_VALUE granted for non-administrative users:

    Extensible Authentication Protocol (Eaphost) uses registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Eaphost:
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Eaphost: ALLOW [unknown]\S-1-5-21-1816462925-3706205934-1807523569-500: KEY_SET_VALUE

[ recommendation ]

Change the permissions of registry keys pertaining to Windows Servies. Service registry keys should never allow KEY_SET_VALUE for low-privileged users.

Title: Insecure (Non-NTFS) File System Used

[ description ]

Some local drives use Non-NTFS file systems. These drive therefore don't allow secure file permissions to be used. Any local user can change any data on these drives.

The following drives use Non-NTFS file systems:

    Drive Z:\ has PrlSF filesystem

[ recommendation ]

Use NTFS filesystems instead of FAT. Ensure that strong file permissions are set - NTFS file permissions are insecure by default after FAT file systems are converted.

Title: User Access Control Setting Allows Malware to Elevate Without Prompt

[ description ]

The security policy setting 'User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode' is set to 'Elevate without prompting' or 'Prompt for consent for non-Windows binaries' (default). This allows malicious programs to elevate without the user agreeing. Metasploit and other free tools can perform such escalation.

The following registry key shows the current policy setting:

    Reg key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin, Value: 5

[ recommendation ]

Alter security policy to 'Prompt for consent' or stronger setting.

Title: Non-Admin Can Change File Paths In Registry

[ description ]

A walk of the registry found some registry keys that can be changed by non-admin users (KEY_SET_VALUE permission). The data in some of those keys appears to be a file or directory path (e.g. c:\..., \host\share, \.\pipe\...). This is a simple regular-expression match so may report false positives. In some instances it may be possible for an low-privilged user to cause other users to follow a malicious UNC file path, forcing disclosure of their netntlm password hash or SMB relay attack. Other path-based attacks may also be possible.

Title: SMB Server Does Not Mandate Packet Signing

[ description ]

SMB clients that connect to this server are not forced to use signing. As signing protects data from modification in transit, clients may end up receiving data that has been maliciously altered by an attacker. This could lead to a compromise of the client if it opens or runs the files accessed - particularly in the case of a domain member access group policy information.

The following registry key shows the current policy setting:

Title: Service Can Be Started By Non-Admin Users

The service-level permissions on some Windows services allow them to be started by non-administrative users. This can often be desirable, in which case this issue can be ignored. However, sometimes it can allow users to expose or exploit a vulnerability connected with the service - e.g. it may listen on the network or it may have been tampered with by an attacker and they now need to start the service. The permission is not always dangerous on its own, but can sometimes aid a local attacker.

Title: Service Can Be Stopped By Non-Admin Users

[ description ]

The service-level permissions on some Windows services allow them to be stopped by non-administrative users. This can often be desirable, in which case this issue can be ignored. However, sometimes it can allow users to evade monitoring services - e.g. Anti-virus. This permission can also be required in order to exploit other weaknesses such as weak file permissions on service executables. The permission is not always dangerous on its own, but can sometimes aid a local attacker.

Title: Non-Admin Can Change Usernames That Are Stored In The Registry

[ description ]

A walk of the registry found some registry keys that can be changed by non-admin users (KEY_SET_VALUE permission). The data in some of those keys appears to be a username. This is a simple regular-expression match so may report false positives. In some instances it may be possible for an low-privilged user to cause another process to run as or otherwise affect a different user account.

The following registry value are affected:

    Registry value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSDTC\Security\AccountName has data ''NT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService'' and permissions:
    ALLOW NT SERVICE\MSDTC: KEY_SET_VALUE
    Registry value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSDTC\Security\AccountName has data ''NT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService'' and permissions:
    ALLOW NT SERVICE\KtmRm: KEY_SET_VALUE

Set strong registry permissions on any values that high privileged processes use to determine usernames.

Title: Directory Creation Allowed On Drive Root

[ description ]

Some of the local drive roots allow non-administrative users to create directories. This could provide attackers with a place to stash hacking tools, or proive legitimacy to malware they are seeking to get other users to run. It is relatively common to allow the creation of directories in the drive root, but it probably isn't required for normal operation. NB: This issue has only been reported for NTFS filesystems. Other non-NTFS file system may also allow this behaviour. A separate issue is reported for non-NTFS filesystems.

The following drives allow non-administrative users to create directories in to their root:

    Drive C:\ allows NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users to add directories

[ recommendation ]

Modify the permissions on the drive roots to only allow administrators to create directories. Revoke this permission from low-privileged users.

Title: Current Working Directory Used For DLL Search - Including Network Locations

[ description ]

CWDIllegalInDllSearch was set to 0. This causes applications (by default) to load DLLs from the current directory - even for network locations. This can lead to malicious DLLs being executed in some attack scenarios. Note that KB2264107 needs to be installed to enable more secure settings - not checked for. Also apps can be secured individually - also not checked for.

The following registry key shows the current policy setting:

    Reg key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\CWDIllegalInDllSearch, Value: None

[ recommendation ]

Consider setting CWDIllegalInDllSearch to 1, 2 or 0xFFFFFFFF to improve security - though this may break some applications. See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107 for further information including how to set CWDIllegalInDllSearch on a per-application basis.

Title: Scheduled Task Calls Non-Existent Program

[ description ]

A Scheduled Task is configured to run a program that doesn't exist. This is not necessarily a security problem unless the file can be maliciously created. This issue gives false-positives for programs which aren't specified using their full path.

The following tasks were affected:

    Task \Microsoft\Windows\Bluetooth\UninstallDeviceTask runs non-existent file BthUdTask.exe
    Task \Microsoft\Windows\UPnP\UPnPHostConfig runs non-existent file sc.exe
    Task \Microsoft\Windows\Windows Defender\Windows Defender Cache Maintenance runs non-existent file C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe
    Task \Microsoft\Windows\Windows Defender\Windows Defender Cleanup runs non-existent file C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe
    Task \Microsoft\Windows\Windows Defender\Windows Defender Scheduled Scan runs non-existent file C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe
    Task \Microsoft\Windows\Windows Defender\Windows Defender Verification runs non-existent file C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe
    Task \Microsoft\Windows\Windows Media Sharing\UpdateLibrary runs non-existent file C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Media Player\wmpnscfg.exe

Title: Windows Autologon Registry Keys Set

[ description ]

One or more of the registry keys for Windows autologon was found to be set. These can explose locally valid logon credentials in cleartext.

The following information was retreived from the registry:

    Registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon had these values set: AutoAdminLogon=1 DefaultDomainName= DefaultUserName=joegray DefaultPassword=[not set]

[ recommendation ]

Review the information below and determine if is exposes sensitive information. Avoid the use of autologin where possible.
